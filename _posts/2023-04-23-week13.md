title: (Week 13) Open Source And... Me
---



Learning about Chayn, a nonprofit organization run by survivors of violence and allies from around the world as well as OpenAQ, a nonprofit providing universal access to air quality data, made me excited about my future role in open-source. After OSSD Spring 2023, I want to contribute to open-source projects that help target marginalized and low-income communities. Thus, projects like Chayn, OpenAQ, or my group project Kolibri, are all opportunities for me to do so. I am hopeful that I can bring resources like these to my communities as they are not currently in use, but definitely can be.
