title: (Week 11) Cathedral & Kolibri 
---


I have two polarizing lessons from Cathedral and the Bazaar that are my favorite:  "Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow." (Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month, Chapter 11) & “If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.” I believe it’s natural to be stuck between letting something go and wanting to optimistically continue. But I would say one always has to take a step back and ask if this is something they really want to continue to pursue, and if staying will be leading to a dead end. At the end of the day, it’s up to the person to decide and it may be circumstantial, but these two lessons were what really stood out to me.

At the end of this week, I’m really content with my group's progress because we’ve reflected on all we have done, and even though we encountered some obstacles I did not anticipate, we are getting through them as a team. I really like how we are in constant communication with the community via GitHub as well as Slack and are constantly communicating any errors we encounter. Our team is appreciative of how welcoming everyone has been because it can definitely be frightening to put our issues out there in the public. But we know that since we are encountering them as a team, there are probably others who have experienced the same. Looking back and seeing how far we’ve come is definitely motivation to keep moving forward these next couple of weeks.
