title: Week 2: Dream Team
---




Thinking about working in a team with new people was anxiety-inducing, but only in the beginning. 


When it comes to doing anything technical, I am used to working on my own, as I get to go at my own pace. But after meeting my teammates and seeing how welcoming and supportive they are, I was relieved. I would even go on to say this was the first time I looked forward to working in a group. This experience gave me, or more so showed me, what a healthy working environment can look like; a mutualistic space where I get to help and also freely ask for help. 


My team consistently met up to complete our tasks together or assign them if necessary.
Since this week we focused on further researching what an open source project consisted of, we were able to come to a clear understanding of what the purpose of each component was. Regardless of how "self-explanatory" the component may have seemed, we all learned something new. I would say this research prepped us very well for the start of our web extension since we got to have a strong foundation of what was required from us to successfully create an open-source project.
