title: (Week 14) The Last Stretch
---

This week, I am looking forward to learning about my peers' projects and their journey with their communities.
It will be nice to put into perspective the different paths that everyone had as well as my own. As for my team's presentation, we are excited to share both the successes and failures of our journey. Regardless of the obstacles, I am content that my team remained consistent and that we were all open to getting through any issue together as a team-- that is what I am most grateful for this semester.
